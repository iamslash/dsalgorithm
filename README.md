 - f(n) = O(g(n)) means c · g(n) is an upper bound on f (n). Thus there exists some constant c such that f (n) is always ≤ c · g(n), for large enough n (i.e. , n ≥ n0 for some constant n0).
 - f(n) = Ω(g(n)) means c · g(n) is a lower bound on f(n). Thus there exists some constant c such that f(n) is always ≥ c · g(n), for all n ≥ n0.
 - f(n) = Θ(g(n)) means c1 · g(n) is an upper bound on f(n) and c2 · g(n) is a lower bound on f(n), for all n ≥ n0. Thus there exist constants c1 and c2 such that f (n) ≤ c1 · g(n) and f (n) ≥ c2 · g(n). This means that g(n) provides a nice, tight bound on f(n).
